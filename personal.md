As a proof of concept, I came up with a way to let artists create Particle Systems in Unity through the use of VOP networks in Houdini. This let the artist set up sophisticated relationships and behaviors not otherwise possible in Shuriken

For this workflow, I used Houdini's Python implementation to evaluate the VOP network and bake it down to a JSON file, which was interpreted in Unity using C# to generate the particle system.
